AB  - In this paper we describe how to use a Game-Based Learning (GBL) approach to help end-user programmers to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills. CT represents a framework consisting of a set of skills such as: abstraction, decomposition and more in general problem solving expressed in a computational form (algorithmic thinking) that can be easily formalised into a computer program. Those skills are beneficial for end-user programmers in order to model a task for being tackled with computational tools, e.g. spreadsheets, domain specific and visual languages. TAPASPlay is an engaging GBL platform designed to help end-user to learn algorithmic thinking.

AB  - The pervasiveness of computer devices in everyday situations poses a fundamental question about Computer Sciences as being part of those known as basic sciences. However, it would be more beneficial not to consider computation only as a technique, but instead as a way of reasoning and problem solving. Under this perspective, there are inherent relationships among the knowledge, skills and attitudes that emanate from this field and those ones commonly related to Math. This paper discusses the relationship between the so-named Computational Thinking and the foundations of Math Education, based on a literature review. Three groups of skills that can be jointly developed by both areas are identified and some challenges and implications for education in Computer Sciences are discussed.

AB  - The growing interest of educational researchers in computational thinking (CT) has led to an expanding literature on assessments of CT skills and attitudes. However, few studies have examined whether CT attitudes influence CT skills. The present study examines the relationship between CT attitudes and CT skills for preservice teachers (PSTs). The Callysto CT test (CCTt) for Teachers was administered to  $n\,\,=$  105 PSTs to measure their CT attitudes and skills. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship of participants’ CT and problem-solving skills with their attitudes toward CT, technology, coding, and data. Findings revealed that CT attitudes predicted CT skills and provided the first step in exploring the validity and reliability of the CCTt instrument.

AB  - In Japan, programming education in elementary schools has begun in 2020, and it is necessary to foster programming thinking effectively. Various learning tools have been developed to introduce programming concepts, and many studies have been conducted to develop tools using music to foster computational thinking that includes programming thinking. In this study, we focused on the affinity between the basic movements of the railway toy and the melodies and chord progressions, and we developed a learning tool to foster computational thinking by combining music and the railway toy. In this study, an activity using this tool was developed and subjects were asked to experience the activity. Based on the subjects' progress in the activity and their opinions in the questionnaire, the improvement of the activity is discussed.

AB  - This paper describes a collaborative project that was conducted to promote Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) Education among pre-service and in-service teachers as well as Teacher Preparation Faculty. More than 40 pre-service and in-service teachers and 9 Education faculty members from three schools participated in a learning experience designed to address the K-12 Computer Science Framework [1] and Maryland's K-12 Computer Science Standards. The collaboration was designed to develop CS/CT knowledge, understanding, skills and application among participants. In phase one of the project, pre-service and in-service teachers explored CS educational hard/software platforms and used open-source sites such as Sphero Edu, Wonder Workshop, Scratch and Code.org. They envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms, and they worked collaboratively to design a problem-based project for their own students. In phase two of the project, teacher preparation faculty were trained to integrate CS and CT into several preservice courses as well as build into the coursework sequence meaningful experiences that would expose future teachers to CS and CT knowledge and skills so that they could then incorporate these into their own K-8 lesson plans. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge. The feedback from the participants shows positive results.

AB  - Programming education is a crucial part of school education and an important way to effectively enhance learners' learning abilities. However, current programming education in secondary schools is not as effective as it could be in concrete implementation. Project-based learning is a possible path for programming education, but it is still difficult to achieve the goal of cultivating innovative talents by project-based learning alone. Therefore, in this paper, we integrate design thinking into project-based learning, firstly, we analyze the connotation of design thinking and explain the necessity of integrating design thinking into project-based learning; secondly, we construct a new model and practice process framework of secondary school programming PBL teaching integrating design thinking based on the general process of project-based learning and the basic model of design thinking, and explain the connotation. Finally, a case study of “Python programming” in the new version of high school IT textbook is conducted to provide reference for the practice of secondary school programming education.

AB  - We recommend using the term Computation in conjunction with a well-defined model of computation whose semantics is clear and which matches the problem being investigated. Computer science already has a number of useful clearly defined models of computation whose behaviors and capabilities are well understood. We should use such models as part of any definition of the term computation. However, for new domains of investigation where there are no appropriate models it may be necessary to invent new formalisms to represent the systems under study.

AB  - In the context of Computer Science (CS) education, one of the most important goals is the development of computational thinking (CT) and problem solving skills. Computational thinking skills are closely related to the CS concepts and approaches. These skills cover fundamental programming concepts such as task decomposition, abstractions and generalization, data structures and algorithms. On the other hand, CS education challenges, promote the search for new educational tools, methods, activities and resources. Consequently, CS education should be extended by adding the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) paradigm principles. The aim of this paper is to show how STEM-driven CS education supports and ensures the development of computational thinking at the high school. We present the already published STEM-driven CS education approach aiming at extending it by introducing a model to assess student achievements, according to the revised Bloom's taxonomy in the connection with CT skills. As a practical implementation, we describe a curriculum of Programming Basics at the high school with respect to STEM-driven aspects and CT skills. We introduce two case studies implemented in the real educational environment. They provide the evidence of availability of our approach.

AB  - Programming is one of the key assets in the modern society. In addition to teaching programming to future programmers, it has become more and more important to teach it alongside computational thinking to all students. We designed and implemented a programming course aimed for teacher students at our university. The goal of the course was to teach programming, computational thinking and the methods and tools used in programming education. The course was divided into two parts: first, the students were taught basic programming skills by utilizing tutorial-based learning with automatically assessed electronic exercises and play-based programming tasks. In the second part, the students utilized the acquired skills by teaching programming integrated into mathematics to children at elementary school level. The students worked really hard throughout the course, completing more than 90 % of all tasks in average. Moreover, the feedback from the tutorial sessions and the practice lessons at schools was mainly positive.

The course introduces the “concepts” and core “processes” of Computational Thinking using a visual programming environment. The design of the course PC-01 includes a set of multimedia content, learning tools and technologies that help teachers and students in the teaching-learning process. These tools allow the teacher the successful delivery of the course content as well as the individual/collective monitoring of students' progress in the course. Students have access to their progress throughout the course and participate in creative and collaborative tasks. This course also serves to introduce transversely educational technologies to many students of primary and secondary education. The technological environment integrates the online teaching resources and the methodological tools of the course. The course uses Scratch 2.0 as the programming environment and Moodle as the learning platform. At present the course is being implemented in public schools in the Dominican Republic.

AB  - The need to attract learners and improve retention in computational thinking classes has never been greater than presently. Alarmingly, research suggests that the relative popularity of computer science in K-12 and colleges is not increasing while other STEM subjects are witnessing substantial rise in enrollment. Moreover, more than one third of those who choose computer science, drop out or fail the first programming class dashing hopes of building a computationally savvy workforce for the emerging global economy. In this paper, we introduce a novel social networking system, called OpenSchool, for learners and educators alike, which is able to double as a contemporary social networking system along the lines of Facebook for instance, and serve the special needs of free-choice STEM learners, computer science learners in particular. We discuss its salient features, highlight its advantages, collaborating capabilities, and learning support for STEM, especially computational thinking, learners.

AB  - With the increased focus on Computational Thinking (CT) in education, there has been an increase in the development of learning platforms to teach CT. The current study developed an Online Inquiry-based learning platform for Computational Thinking (CT-ONLINQ) to support CT activities using Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) pedagogy. IBL-based CT steps include algorithm design, analysis, and comparison of algorithms. The platform allows students to explore multiple solutions and provides hints as support during problem-solving activities. A 4-week experimental study was conducted to evaluate the usability of the online platform. A total of 79 9th-grade students volunteered to participate in this study to complete six activities. Subsequently, the students completed the SUS questionnaire and open-ended feedback questions. Results showed that around 80% of the students scored above the “Good” category (70-80), with a total average score of 78.45. Also, we analyzed the difference in rating scores among groups based on multiple background factors. Findings showed an average rating above 4 with no significant difference between the ratings among factors such as gender and math performance (below-above average math scores). In addition, analysis of the feedback comments showed that the platform is user-friendly, with students enthusiastic about learning coding on the platform.

AB  - The computer science industry suffers from a significant gender gap. This situation likely hinders the creation of inclusive and user-friendly systems due to a bias in perspectives. To narrow this gender gap, this study investigates how females program to increase interest in computer sciences. Specifically, 60 open Scratch projects on the web are analyzed to clarify differences in the Computational Thinking scores with respect to gender. The difference in the Computational Thinking score by gender suggests that the gap may be due to the lack of the Synchronization element in female users’ projects. A deeper understanding of how people program based on gender should support creating an effective and inclusive learning environment and allow educators to create programming materials that attract both genders equally into the field.

AB  - Scratch is a programming environment, which is widely adopted as the first language to enter the programming world. Since Scratch projects are rich in multimedia resources, it can be time-consuming to judge them by hand, requiring manual execution with the understanding of each project. Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners’ projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity. Through the correlation analysis between DWES CT scores and experts’ ratings, we find that compared with Dr. Scratch, the correlation coefficient has increased.

AB  - The assessment of computational thinking (CT) skills based on text-based programming is a necessary part of the implementation of CT education in higher education. However, the current research on CT assessment is mostly single-approach, which is not effective in accurately measuring numerous competencies of CT skills and has the disadvantage of assessment limitation. In order to solve the problem of assessment limitations, this paper defines the content of CT evaluation from the perspective of text-based programming and constructs a multidimensional test method. Different test schemes are selected according to the characteristics of CT skills, and assessment tools are developed by combining the question test, programming test and scale survey, and the assessment tools are used to evaluate and analyze learners' CT skills from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The results show that the evaluation indicators and test questions designed on text-based programming are more consistent with the evaluation objectives. And the approach of evaluating CT skills from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives can reflect learners' CT skills more comprehensively and accurately.

AB  - In contrast to the field of computer-supported or computer-assisted language learning (CALL), which has been investigated intensively for the last decades since the beginning of e-learning and technology-enhanced learning, computational thinking and computer science concepts are not quite common in the context of language lessons. Computational thinking is a problem solving process that, at first sight, has not much to do with language learning. However, as demanded by Jeannette Wing in 2006, it should be taught to everyone like reading, writing and mathematics. By introducing computational thinking in language lessons e.g. through modeling we could "kill two birds with one stone": On the one hand, we can teach computational thinking and basics of computer science at all school levels even if there is no related subject, e.g. in primary schools. On the other hand, computational thinking tools like modeling can support language learning in different ways and help to train text comprehension, to acquire and elaborate vocabulary or to visualize grammar rules etc. This paper describes some creative possibilities of introducing computational thinking through modeling in language lessons in primary and secondary education. Besides best practices, it further presents some experiences and results gained from teacher observation, interviews and informal feedback from students and teachers.

Embedding these skills in the K-12 and University curricula is necessary for training the next generation of thinkers. A widely adopted approach to doing so is through simple and visual programming languages like Scratch and engaging assignments like video-game construction. In this work, we report on an empirical study we conducted with senior undergraduate education students aiming to understand how prior experience enables students to better develop their computation-thinking skills through a Scratch-based video-game assignment.

AB  - While computational thinking (CT) has been identified as one of the fundamental 21st century skills that can be applied to different domains, school students usually show negative attitude toward learning CT. Educational games have been applied by several researchers to address related issues faced for promoting CT. Even though such games have shown some success in promoting CT, they fall short when it comes to acquisition of CT skills (they rather promote abstract and conceptual knowledge) and offering adaptivity to each player. To address these issues and improve the existing games, we developed an adaptive game called AutoThinking for teaching both CT concepts and skills, engaging students with individually tailored gameplay and learning. We conducted a qualitative study aimed at understanding the cognitive and affective experiences of Estonian primary school children. The findings showed that AutoThinking is making children feel challenged, happy, and confident, while activating their thinking process during the gameplay. All children perceived the game positively and found it to be a good tool for learning.

An evaluation rubric is proposed to identify the level of development of the concepts of abstraction, generalization, decomposition and algorithmic thinking. The rubric was applied by Computer Science teachers in the evaluation of activities of the CS Unplugged project. It was possible to observe that all concepts of the CT were present in the Unplugged activities, but without reaching the maximum score of the rubric.

Several tools have been reported in the literature to support the development of computational thinking. This paper reports a Systematic Literature Review to present the characteristics that have made successful web systems that support the development of computational thinking in recent years and the reported limitations. Eighteen primary studies were selected where the strategies used are usually learning through lessons, practicing with exercises, working through games, and using feedback. The systems found have been used at different elementary, middle, high school, and bachelor's degree levels. Finally, the main limitations reported in using these systems were mainly the difficulty of the topics, the previous knowledge that the students should have, the attitude that the students showed and the lack of motivation. Finally, we make some recommendations to software engineering curriculum planners and programming teachers about systems for developing computational thinking.

Computational thinking has been increasingly encouraged, not only for those who wish to become computer scientists, but also to develop other important skills that are used to solve problems, using a combination of critical thinking and fundamentals of computing. The research used was qualitative of the phenomenological type. In the analysis, the teachers involved concluded that to solve a problem, even if it is Ecology, it is not necessary to use a computer to process the algorithm to find the solution, a student can create an algorithm and process it and find the answer.

AB  - Computational thinking is one of the aspects emphasised in the Malaysian education system. However, the learning aids in the form of mobile applications that support computational thinking for mathematics are very limited in Malaysia. With that notion, this study aims to develop a mobile app for conceptual recognition pattern which is one of the skills in computational thinking for secondary school mathematics. The ADDIE model comprises of five phases which are analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation are used as references for the development purpose. The earliest three phases of the ADDIE model focus on the aspect of application development. While the last two phases involve the aspects of appraisal from the applications which has been developed and it involved 23 mathematics teachers. Questionnaires with Likert Scale were used in the study as instruments to measure the five main aspects of the applications which are facilitation, usefulness, design, knowledge and suitability. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics based on frequency and percentage. The results of the analysis showed that the majority of respondents gave positive feedback on the five aspects measured in using the application. In conclusion, the mobile app of the pattern recognition concept for computational thinking skills for this mathematics subject has been agreed by the respondents to have good characteristics and brings great potential for the use by teachers and students in mathematics' classes.

AB  - Advances in computer technology have expanded our capacity to solve problems on a scale never imagined, using strategies previously unavailable to us. Today’s "digital natives" have grown up in a world where technology is rapidly evolving, creating new fields of study, new types of jobs, and requiring new skill sets. Algorithmic and computational thinking are foundations for solving different problems from all domains and are not always closely related to computers and programming. They are currently primarily used in teaching computer science and STEM subjects but can be applied to all subjects and in all life situations. The paper presents the need to develop computational thinking in various subjects of primary education, with particular emphasis on combining digital ("plugged") and non-digital ("unplugged") activities, as well as on the development of algorithmic thinking. Four methodological scenarios with activities for the development of algorithmic thinking in primary education are presented.

CT can be easily integrated into science lessons with the right policies, programs, and practices in place. This paper explores the current practices of CT in a northeast US state based on survey data collected from teachers. The research uncovers how much teaching time is spent teaching science and the percentage of lessons that have CT concepts and approaches present in the science instruction while describing what these lessons look like. This paper then discusses the next steps for implementation efforts based on the described CT practices in elementary science.

AB  - Research and full paper. Digital games are increasingly a part of our daily lives and are already considered teaching and learning tools. However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area. The results of the exploratory study show that the proposed approach can favor the development of computational thinking, as well as motivate the production of texts, developing students' reading and writing skills, therefore contributing to the improvement of learning assessments.

AB  - Teaching with educational robots is increasingly being integrated into the curriculum. However, many teachers, and especially those who have been in practice for a long time have not been trained in this area. Therefore, in-service teacher training in educational robotics is now an important area. In the framework of the Erasmus FERTILE project, materials on this topic have been developed. Based on these, teacher training is being implemented in several European countries in 2024. Participants are introduced to educational robotics in combination with arts, with a particular focus on the development of computational thinking skills. In this paper, we focus on the final part of the training, in which a peer assessment using a rubric was used to evaluate the projects created. We demonstrate the inter-rater reliability of the rubric applied and use the results of the peer assessment to verify the participants' level of understanding of computational thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) does not require profound knowledge of computer science (CS). Vice versa, it helps students organize and build up new knowledge around the core CS concepts they encounter on the daily basis. Furthermore, CT provides a set of problem-solving skills and enhances analytical abilities that are crucial for the young generation to succeed in modern world pervaded with technology. Teaching the principles of computing to students with non-computing tracks of study provides them with a competitive advantage and breaks down stereotypes around CS. Our approach is to introduce a topic related to world issues and students' interests while concealing its relation to CS until students' interest and attention are captured. The approach takes advantage of pattern-matching abilities that are naturally wired in our brain to improve understanding and make the obtained knowledge persist in memory. The paper discusses some of the modules developed as part of the Inspire-CT project that can be delivered in one or part of a class period at high school or middle school.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) can amplify learners' skill sets so that they become excellent problem-solvers. Game-Based Learning and Collaborative Learning are two approaches that may aid in the development of CT skills. This paper describes a framework based on Game and Collaborative Learning which aims to enhance the CT teaching that improves students' social skills in a fun way. The framework stands out by including collaborative learning features defined in the main literature. Also, the strategy was developed specifically to fit the games' dynamics. The approach was evaluated via metacognitive and transactive analysis and by a survey. The results showed evidence that the method is able to stimulate interaction among students to apply problem-solving strategies.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT), one of the necessary and fundamental skills for students in the 21st century, is gaining more attention in K-12. The premise of integrating CT with other subjects is to promote school teachers with high self-efficacy in CT. Towards this, we developed a three-week Scratch online professional development(PD) course based on MIT CT framework, then implemented an online training among 84 primary and secondary school teachers from different subjects including Chinese, Mathematics, English, and Computer Science. To examine the effect of its impact on teachers' self-efficacy in CT, a quasi-experiment method of a single group pretest-posttest was conducted, and quantitative and qualitative data were collected from scales, artifacts, and interviews. The results revealed that the online PD course significantly improved teaching self-efficacy in CT of these teachers. The findings indicated that online PD integrated with MIT CT framework through block-based programming was a potential approach to effectively promote teaching self-efficacy in CT for primary and secondary school teachers.

The survey results showed that T{h}inker provides an engaging way to learn computational thinking and programming; has the potential to offer a variety of project opportunities; is easier to tinker with and (upon little practice) can provide appropriate difficulty level for entry-level undergraduate students while implementing the project ideas. This engaging potential of T{h}inker can be attributed primarily to the exploratory design and problem solving style it promoted in the laboratory against few predefined ways of problem solving expected in typical programming laboratory sessions.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) has been described as the use of abstraction, automation and analysis skills for problem solving, thus becoming a set of fundamental skills for the 21st century. Many initiatives have emerged to promote early development of CT skills. However, to date, there are no studies in which CT is developed in minority groups, such as individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a Game Design Workshop aimed at teenagers with Autism Spectrum Disorders. An analysis of the artifacts produced by the participants of a pilot offering of the workshop was performed using a rubric for CT skills acquisition. The results showed that the participants, all of them with high-functioning autism and no previous experience with programming, acquired intermediate level skills related to CT.

AB  - While there has been a rising interest in computational thinking (CT) and a push to include it into the K-12 curriculum, there is little empirical evidence that a class that teaches CT will have any measurable long-term effects on student performance. Using robotics as an example of CT instruction, I propose to examine a high school that has had a large number of robotics students over the past six years to find evidence for the long-term benefits of CT. I will analyze school records (e.g. STEM class enrollment, STEM test scores, SAT scores) for differences between robotics and non-robotics students and compare interviews with selected students.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience of positive outcomes with increased motivation and retention in teaching an introductory Computer Science course with Python programming. Without reinventing the wheel, we infused few well established pedagogies by integrating and evaluating Computational Thinking (CT) skills in a meaningful way. We integrated CT with existing curriculum alongside programming and teaching general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or languages at the beginning. Our aim here is not only to teach a programming language per se, but also to teach, at the beginning, the different ways of problem solving, logical reasoning, algorithm design, and programming constructs with minimal or no emphasis on syntax. A positive learning experience is successfully developed for our students by using appropriate pedagogies and strategies. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey as well as a pre- and post-CT test were conducted on student cohort in different sections. The statistical analysis of the survey and test results show evidence of improvement in student's problem solving and coding skills as well as increase in motivation towards programming.

AB  - Various didactic strategies to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills have been successful in terms of student engagement and educational outcomes. However, monitoring the learning progress of students is still a hurdle to teachers and researchers. In this context, we explore the use of self-organizing maps for analyzing games produced in a game building workshop offered simultaneously to technical education students in Brazil and to undergraduate students in Computer Engineering in Chile. Metrics from seven CT features present in the games were extracted with the Dr. Scratch tool and used as an input in the training process. The results allowed a clustering analysis considering the identified features and the correlation between learning behaviors. The organization of the map reflected a progressive skill acquisition identified by features present in the developed games. Also, it could be identified that students of both educational levels reached similar levels of CT skill development.

AB  - Broadening participation and increasing equity in computer science (CS) have been goals of the computing field for decades. Initiatives seeking to increase access to CS have led to an increase in elementary schools teaching computational thinking (CT), but students are often instructed by classroom teachers who have no formal training in CT or CS. Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS. Our findings suggest teachers would benefit from explicit support to provide opportunities for students currently underrepresented in CS and to offer more equitable opportunities to students regardless of their CS background.

AB  - As Computational Thinking (CT) becomes an increasingly necessary skill, it is crucial to examine how CT can be taught in the classroom. Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) is a practical concept to examine how CT education can be developed. This systematic literature review presents the discussion of K-8 teachers’ PCK in the implementation of CT- related activities in the classroom. Studies were extracted from Google Scholar’s database. Among these studies, 14 articles were deemed to be relevant for a more in-depth examination. Findings from this preliminary literature review suggest that teachers have clear purposes and goals for teaching CT and various instructional strategies for teaching CT. However, the existing studies lacked information about teachers’ knowledge and beliefs regarding the methods for assessing students’ CT. Practical implications and future directions to enhance K-8 teachers’ PCK on CT are discussed in this study.

AB  - This study reports a pre-college initiative that aims to integrate computational thinking (CT) in an integrated STEM learning environment in community centers' after-school programs for upper-level elementary school students. The initiative takes a collaborative approach that engages a range of stakeholders including higher institution's STEM educational researchers and disciplinary experts, a school district, three community centers and their satellite campus that serve Title I schools, and both in-service and pre-service teachers to develop and implement an integrated “STEM + CT” curriculum. The design and development of the integrated STEM+CT curriculum was guided by project-based learning (PBL) that engages students in sustained project-based activities and requires students to apply multiple STEM content knowledge and skills to solve a problem, in after-school programs where they enjoy large blocks of dedicated time to learn and practice CT and STEM. The implementation of the curriculum was led by in-service teachers in community centers' after-school programs who serve as facilitators and learners, and bring a depth of pedagogical knowledge, and who also benefit from such sustained interactions. This collaborative initiative brings relevant stakeholders together and helps build a researcher-practitioner partnership that aims to design, study, improve, and scale innovations in teaching and learning, which facilities the solving of a shared challenge of educational practice - how to integrate CT in K-12 STEM learning? - in this study. Lessons learned from the collaborative process are also discussed.

AB  - The concern on promoting the development of Computational Thinking (CT) in children has increased over the years. Games are recognized as a good strategy for presenting CT and for engaging children to the learning of its concepts. Hand gestures are a form of interaction widely used in video-games. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate how children feel and interact when using hand gestures in the context of learning tools. And this number decrease in studies about CT learning. In this paper, we explore the feedback of 29 children about their interaction by using hand gestures in a game to stimulate the CT which we called CT game. We also compare this type of interaction to touch. Additionally, we examine how both, hand gestures and touch, can impact on accomplishing of the goals of the game phases. Our findings revealed the children kept more engaged when using hand gestures, and consequently, this affected their concentration on the game purpose.

AB  - This document describes the development of a STEM course intended to improve the Computational Thinking of university students (CT). The main instructional tool for this course is the BEAM robot, a robotics paradigm that proposes simple robots whose behavior can be controlled without software programming. The programming of this robot is implicit in its morphology, so its actions and goals are codified from its construction. A three-phase curriculum is designed to achieve the objective: propaedeutic, robot assembly, and CT. On the basis of these phases, the course is constructed modularly and implemented virtually, while students receive construction kits. Each phase aims to foster the many facets of CT, such as decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, debugging, iteration, and generalization. Students’ responses to pre-and post-course surveys, as well as evaluation activities and logs, are analyzed to determine the course’s impact on them. In addition to other STEM disciplines (electrical, electronic, mechanical, and WEEE), the course substantially improves the CT.

AB  - Game-based learning (GBL) is a popular innovative pedagogical framework for developing Computational Thinking (CT) skills. The base idea is to use games to help create awareness and generated needed CT skills and abilities; in short, it is “games for CT” approach. This is however, one part of the equation for understanding and developing CT in our modern digital age. The other part of the equation lies in using “CT for games”. This paper addresses this perspective to aid in the understanding and framing of the elusive CT concept. In “CT for games”, this paper highlights and draws attention to using CT for developing games instead of using games to develop CT. The core contributions of the paper are a “CT for games” proposed framework; selected variants of health games and observations of “Rebel Design”. Readers can benefit from a perspective with a different focus and increase awareness and understanding of CT with the hope of grooming future leaders with required CT problem-solving skills and abilities and applying “Rebel Design” for games.

AB  - Pair programming (PP) is an effective and operable approach to improve Computational Thinking (CT). However, the process of PP is complex to understand for students at the elementary level, which needs to be supported. Collaboration scripts is a promising way to structure the collaborative process through three mechanisms: pp forming mechanism, role-task mechanism, the feedback mechanism. We conducted a pilot study to examine the effectiveness of collaboration in students' use of collaboration scripts and furthermore to evaluate the development of CT and math. Both quantitative and qualitative data about the students' CT skills, mathematical achievements and perceptions of collaboration scripts were collected. The results showed that the PP with collaboration scripts can improve the CT skills, mathematical achievements; facilitate higher collaborative relationship; give students good perceptions by teacher's feedback.

AB  - The disappointing results that Brazilian education has been showing in external evaluations by international organizations cause us concern. Technologies are here to stay and it is therefore necessary, in some way, to change this paradigm with regard to the role that the teacher plays, from consumer to producer of technological resources. And, trying to contribute to this extremely complex scenery, this paper intends to show how a proposal launched in teacher education combined aspects of gamification and computational thinking, aiming to bring another look at teaching practice, or at least, increase the pedagogical repertoire of fellow Science and Mathematics teachers who participated in the meeting promoted by the Department of Education of the city of Taubaté, in the state of São Paulo. As a proposal, a suggestion of gamified activity in the style of a game known as “escape room” was presented, using the Google Forms tool. We note that insecurity with technological tools or lack of knowledge about some features of these same tools is still a factor that causes many concerns among teachers. We concluded that reflection on ourpractice is fundamental, and, in a way, we realize that we have managed to broaden our horizons about the use of certain technological tools.

We were interested in the frequency of this phenomena, awareness and general experience of adolescents with sexting and in general in Instagram social network security regarding adolescents. Results in terms of the danger of this phenomena are clear and demonstrable: a significant amount of the teenagers came across with it. The linkage and necessity of awareness in terms of secure behaviour on the internet and relevance with computational thinking is obvious but out of scope of this work.

We identified 21 publications in SCOPUS and coded them for comparison and synthesis. Through a meta-analysis, we found a medium effect size (g =0.656; p<; 0.001) supporting the influence of CS learning on students' change of perception of CT. Through qualitative synthesis, results show that CS learning experience influences perception of CT in terms of self-efficacy, behavioral & emotional engagement, and awareness of careers. Findings provide insights to facilitate CT education strategies and promote educational equity in the STEM field.

AB  - In this paper, we describe an interdisciplinary approach using STEM to solving a real-world problem involving poaching. This integrated STEM experience helped a team of researchers that included students from K-12, undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty to collaboratively understand, design and test potential solutions to the problem. The team employed an engineering based Design-Thinking framework combined with effective brainstorming strategies that have been well-established in business, marketing and commercial environments along with a computational mathematics problem solving approach. Not only this integrated STEM experience provided an opportunity for the team of researchers to develop professionally but also gave them an opportunity to become change agents to transform institutional practices and to engage the broader community to inspire the next generation STEM workforce. Specifically, the project framework guided the research team to propose potential integrated STEM based solutions including the application of drones to track illegal poaching as well as the development of an intelligent sensor based tracking system which are validated via sophisticated mathematical and probabilistic algorithms. This overall experience has clearly helped to establish STEM education partnerships and alliances outside traditional boundaries and has helped to create new synergies for all stakeholders who are invested in solving the problem of poaching. Specifically, it has helped to develop an international research experience for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who now have a unique perspective on solving real-world problems in developing countries. The program has helped to promote the much needed awareness of using STEM based solutions to solve global challenges through a multi-disciplinary collaborative approach involving students and faculty from mathematical sciences and engineering who continue to collaborate.

AB  - While there is growing recognition of the need to support young learners as they develop computational thinking (CT) skills, this paper advocates for an increased focus on computational identity (CI) and digital empowerment (DE) in particular, as we posit that these CT skills will help young learners become self-motivated, innovative creators. When nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development tools. This paper advances two key approaches to address these issues: 1) A critical computational literacy approach to engage youth in developing personally meaningful applications that have impact in the real world; 2) the use of a tool, like MIT App Inventor, that lowers barriers to creating useful, impactful technology. Using two case-based studies, we show how these two approaches have supported youth in developing applications that respond to meaningful challenges in their communities and helped them to establish their computational identities and digital empowerment.

AB  - This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of a robotics-based learning environment using an educational design research approach. Contemporary teaching should prepare learners for everyday and working life, suggesting that this can only be achieved by implementing Digital Education from primary education onwards. Since computer science education is planned to be anchored in the Austrian primary school curriculum as an interdisciplinary competence development, research into teaching methods and content suitable for this area is becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling. Hence, the development of the learning environment and the didactic approach gained from qualitative results of interviews and observations from the first cycle of the research project are presented, providing plausible arguments for further implementing this robotics-based learning environment.

AB  - In recent years, with the rise of the concept of Computational Thinking, the issue about College Computer teaching reforms has received wide attention. A high percentage of the research nowadays focuses on how to impart knowledge of computer in the perspective of computational thinking. But more importantly, the research ignores an important way to train thinking - practice. This paper starts with the “College Computer Curriculum”, which is the first computer course for undergraduate students. By using virtual reality technology, this paper gives the college teacher an experimental design method of “College Computer Curriculum”. Some exploratory research works have been performed to explain how to embody the basic problems of computer public course. Finally, we introduce a set of virtual experiment libraries, which are independent research and development. These experiments have already achieved excellent results in the practical teaching of college computer curriculum.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is defined as the thought process of formulating problems and expressing their solutions. In recent times, children increasingly program and CT is a fundamental skill to master. Research shows children often lack such skill. In this work, we contribute an analysis of the ROOT robot system and its associated curriculum to aid in the development of CT skills in children aged 4–10 years old (in China). In particular, we measure the concepts of abstraction, analysis, generalization, algorithmic thinking, logical thinking, sequential problem solving, self-confidence, and self-checking capability throughout a 10-week course. The results show 71% students developed “Excellent” CT performance and 29% achieved “Good” performance. The key lesson is that children's CT skills develop positively when programming with the ROOT learning platform.

AB  - This Research-to-Practice Full Paper examines the Bebras Challenge tasks, a Computational Thinking (CT) contest that does not require programming knowledge. Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.

Firstly, the definition, classification and function of design sketch are explained. Secondly, its importance in the product design process is analyzed. Then design sketch is compared with computer rendering. The uncertainty of design sketch is presented to reveal its ambiguity. Thirdly, the relationship between the ambiguity of design sketch and creative thinking is discussed. Finally, the teaching points of design sketch are proposed from two aspects of presentation techniques and training contents. Appropriate drawing tools and techniques should be chosen according to the characteristics of different stages of the design process and progressive training should be insisted on, so that design sketch can really serve as a primer for the successive courses of product design.

AB  - The computational processing methods appeared to overcome the drawbacks of the symbolic processing method. Recently the serious limitations of the computational processing methods have been found through the development of the highly intelligent user interface systems. The simple solutions to the limitations are the return to the symbolism or the use of the hierarchical system architecture. However it is indispensable deeply to combine the symbolic and computational processing in order to realize the highly intelligent system. The leading attempts toward the combination of computational and symbolic processing are overviewed. The level of the combination is not deep, high and wide enough. Our approach based on the emergent recurrent neural network and the language processing toward the deep fusion of symbolic and computational processing is proposed. In this new architecture, the symbolic processing and the computational processing should affect each other at anytime, at anywhere and at any abstract level.

AB  - The CDIO Framework within engineering education is based on the idea that graduates should be capable of conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating (i.e., CDIO) complex systems within a team-based learning environment. As an approach to engineering education, it aims to create an active, experiential learning setting where product and process are considered fundamental to the curriculum. Modern pedagogical strategies and innovative teaching methods allow for the implementation of the CDIO approach, where students are supported to develop deep knowledge, manage the process of designing and exploiting new items and systems, and evaluate the impact of the scientific-technological process on society. This article will highlight aspects of this approach in the development of a practical quantum electronics session. In particular, it will focus on the developed principles of an innovative practice-targeted programme that can support the development of students' engineering thinking through the linkage of education and professional activities. As graduates, the students will need to be able to create innovative engineering systems as well as integrate their understanding of natural and technological sciences to generate novel concepts. They will also need to be proficient in professional ethics and have knowledge of business and entrepreneurship fundamentals. As such, this indicates the need for a strategically-focused curriculum that supports the development of a range of transversal skills required for industry. In this paper, the CDIO model is detailed as a means of transforming engineering education on a large scale. In order to develop the fundamental framework of creative awareness sessions for quantum technologies and their applications, this study attempted to further explore and provide more specific illustrations of the concepts relating to CIDO and to consider how they may be applied within an engineering context. The current work will present and evaluate the principles of an innovative teaching technique aimed at providing students with the opportunities to understand pioneering technologies for future applications.

AB  - Computational Thinking education and training are considered crucial activities to achieve success in later challenges like computer programming. To train the brain to think in logical terms it is necessary to use adequate resources. In this paper we address the difficult problem that is assessing efficacy of a given resource to the Computation Thinking development. To discuss that topic we will use the Melodic System which is a physical learning resource capable of constructing melodic sequences in a logical manner to be used by visually impaired people. Melodic was created aiming at training Computational Thinking through music and sounds and its impact in the learning process must be evaluated. This paper presents the tests and results applied to this intent, while also providing a general and summarized presentation of the Melodic System itself.

AB  - Algorithm has been heavily used to provide a comfort life for us: from finding the best route in Google map to biometrics authentication on your phone. The significant of algorithm defines Computational thinking (CT) as one of the 21st Century skills. Although CT has been integrated into the education in the past years, many students still struggle with CT concept due to the complication of the topic and limited learning methods provided in school environment. To provide alternative learning approach for algorithmic thinking, we propose a game-base learning system called Protobot. Protobot requires students to apply their CT knowledge, especially the algorithmic thinking to solve problems in the gameplay. The experimental results demonstrate that Protobot fosters the algorithmic thinking skill of the players as well as provides the amusement during the gameplay.

AB  - Computational thinking and creative thinking are valuable tools both within and outside of computer science (CS). The goal of the project discussed here is to increase students' achievement in CS courses through a series of computational creativity exercises (CCEs). In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Computational thinking is one barrier to enculturating as a professional engineer. We created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD) as an instructional tool that can identify at-risk first-year engineering students. The purpose of this study is to provide construct validity, internal consistency reliability, item characteristics, and criterion validity evidence for this diagnostic. From fall 2020 to fall 2021, 469 students from three institutions in the United States took the diagnostic. The data from 152 students at one institution was used to provide evidence of predictive validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach  $\alpha $  of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades. The ECTD can have a broad impact because it provides a tool to gauge the entry-level skills of students, enabling early curriculum interventions to help retention and persistence to graduation. We make the case that the ECTD could contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce in engineering.

AB  - Several initiatives have been created to promote Computational Thinking (CT) abilities in students. There are multiple approaches of assessing CT and wide abilities and skills involved. However, the evidence on how to assess CT has not yet been systematically grouped or reviewed. The goal of our study is to identify and classify approaches to promote CT and the different ways of assessing CT abilities. To achieve this goal, a systematic mapping study was planned and executed. The results reveal that: (i) programming courses are the most common pedagogical approaches to promote CT for K-12 students; (ii) multiple skills are involved in CT, but solving problems, algorithms, and abstraction are most common abilities assessed; and (iii) codes and multi-choice questionnaires are the most common artifacts for assessing CT abilities. This study points out to the fact that there are open questions for exploring and developing new researches for promoting and assessing CT abilities.

AB  - Computational models and simulations can be powerful tools to help learners understand a wide variety of natural phenomena. However, understanding and learning from computational models requires learners to comprehend the rules agents follow that lead to emergent outcomes. Blocks-based programming is useful in scaffolding learners in the early stage of programming tasks. We posit that students can authentically interact with agent-based modeling via a blocks-based dialect of the popular ABM language NetLogo, dubbed NetTango, across many difficulty levels. Specifically, we discuss three different activities in which we have integrated blocks-based programming into STEM classrooms that show blocks can be used for activities of increasing computational engagement and difficulty.

AB  - Cognitive testing is concerned with quantitative and qualitative evaluation of an individual's intellectual functioning in its broad sense. Tests for evaluating cognitive components are based on submitting the subject to a given task and then assessing performance according to an established set of reference parameters. In order to analyze subject's behavior and test results, a software tool was developed based upon digital ink technology, which permits the digitalization of the assessment procedure, from the undertaking of the test to the production of the assessment results. By doing so, the test procedure is computerized and its data is saved in InkML format and processed to analyze tasks previously defined by the evaluator. We have used this tool to develop a Computational Thinking test defined within the Cattell-Horn-Carroll CHC framework of intelligence. Further investigating the relationship between fluid intelligence and computational thinking allows a better understanding of the main set of cognitive skills which need to be developed by students and professionals that aim to work in this domain. Moreover, it is suggested that assessments, independent of their context, may benefit from using the InkML tool, mainly due to the richer set of information that can be collected.

AB  - This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development and implementation of an innovative online adaptive gamification platform for learning Computational Thinking (CT). CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is an essential skill in digital society. With the growing momentum in integrating CT into K-12 education, a higher need can be seen in developing proper assessment tools to measure what students have learned about CT. Although numerous attempts have been made to design CT assessment tools, there is a scarcity of well-validated tests for summative assessment aimed at lower primary students. To bridge this gap, we designed the Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primacy (CTt-LP), targeting students aged 6–8. This study presents the test design, content validation, and pilot testing. For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2. Results indicate that the test is balanced regarding the difficulty level for the target group. Item analysis was conducted for each item, based on which decisions about the refinement of the test were made. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Computational thinking (CT) is a term invented by “J.M. Wing, 2006” to describe a set of thinking skills, behaviors, and approaches that are integral to solving complex challenges using a computer and widely applicable in the information society. CT is a must for today’s and tomorrow’s talent. The added-value of this early exposure to CT is that it will help juniors to shape a solid basis of algorithmic and data structures, which form the basic nuts and bolts of the mechanics of computer programming. The added value of developing professionals has its clear impact on the economy perspective, in light of the forecasted demand for today and tomorrow. (World economic forum, 2017) Computer programming is an outstanding way to develop computational thinking skills. It has been taken programming as a useful way for juniors to learn problem solving and computational thinking with an affirmative and quantifiable effect on juniors’ achievement, not only in areas such as math and science, but also in language skills, creativity, interpersonal skills and social emotional interaction.

AB  - Presents an analysis of the issues pertaining to computational emergence and emotion in (cognitive) agent systems whether their ecology is carbon or silicon-based. We consider how a developing computational theory of cognition can be used to monitor and manage interactions with and within complex systems and so harness unwanted and emergent states and behaviours before the computational system becomes dysfunctional. A comparison is made between these emergent computational states and emotional states. The opening scenario provides a global systems context for the interaction between man and the cyber-domain. The final focus of the paper weaves these threads together in a consideration of the nature of goals, emotion and philosophical issues related to (computational) modelling.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) skills are generally regarded as a basic ability for problem-solving and are gradually filtering down to younger age groups. Existing research has attempted to increase interaction and enhance the learning interest of elementary school students through block-based programming environments represented by Scratch. However, criticism suggests that this approach has potential long-term constraints on CT education. Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students’ learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments. A total of 108 fifth-grade students participated in the experiment and were divided into two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) and a control group (CG). The students in experimental groups all undertook game-based learning, while EG1 students used C++ and EG2 students used Scratch; CG students used C++ for traditional algorithm-based learning. Findings suggest that traditional programming languages with game-based learning can also substantially improve learning interest, which can promote the efficiency of improving CT for students who already have some motivation and foundation for learning. But for students who still lack motivation, are also encouraged to develop an interest in a block-based programming environment. Teachers can choose the most appropriate approach for students to find the best balance between learning efficiency and long-term interest.

AB  - Research Purpose and Contribution: The study aimed to construct an evaluation framework for assessing pupils’ computational thinking (CT) during classroom learning problem solving. As a self-report evaluation scale for pupils, this evaluation framework further enriched the CT assessment instruments for pupils and provided a specialized instrument for experts to evaluate pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations during classroom learning. Background: CT cultivation and assessment methods are hot topics in the field of education. CT assessment can effectively test the effect of CT cultivation. There are many CT assessment methods, of which evaluation frameworks are an effective self-reporting assessment method. Existing studies on self-reported CT evaluation frameworks are commonly applicable to students at different stages. However, few studies have focused on the specific context from the perspective of practice for pupils. Thus, the evaluation framework of pupils’ CT is worth exploring. Intended Outcomes: A CT evaluation framework for evaluating pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations in classroom learning was constructed to facilitate researchers’ understanding of pupils’ CT levels and problem-solving skills. Application Design: In this study, data from 897 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades were collected using an online questionnaire that included 27 items about CT. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item analysis were conducted to analyze the data in this study, with 17 items remaining in the final evaluation framework. Findings: The fitting validity, convergence validity, and discriminant validity all met the recommended criteria, which showed that the evaluation framework was effective. The total reliability of CT was 0.911, indicating that the consistency and reliability of the evaluation framework constructed in this study were satisfied.

AB  - Efforts to broaden participation in computing have revealed the need for a deeper theoretical and empirical understanding of how girls of color form computing identities. In this paper, we use the concept of identities-in-practice as an analytical frame to examine how girls of color engage in computational thinking practices. Our research investigates how the identities of girls of color can be leveraged as funds of knowledge in learning spaces and asks the following research question: How does centering the identities of girls of color impact their engagement with computational thinking practices? We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences. By focusing on the girls' identities, the program re-imagines computational experiences by fostering interactions with computational thinking from a personal perspective. Ultimately, we argue that centering girls' identities should be viewed as an integral part of the learning process and not tangential.

AB  - Computational Thinking (CT) is vital in today's digital era, especially in Engineering Education. While no official policy or teaching framework on CT education has been established in the Netherlands, a Western European country, there have been various initiatives for the integration of CT into the curriculum. Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in CT integration, we surveyed the perceptions and intentions of teachers in tertiary education in the Netherlands. Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities. To foster the integration of CT in tertiary education, our findings suggest the need for further development of higher education teacher training programs focused on CT and its relation to CS. Additionally, there is a call for further exploration of how to enhance teachers' performance expectancy and effort expectancy.

The application presents those metaphors to users in an interactive, visual fashion, with the goal of fostering critical thinking and creativity. This paper describes the computational techniques and interface design of metaViz, and presents an evaluation of the tool based on a controlled experiment showing that metaViz is more effective at fostering critical thinking than blog reading alone. This research draws attention to the need for tools that facilitate blog reading while encouraging critical engagement with the text, helping to lay the groundwork for enabling new ways of reading and interacting with blogs.

AB  - The contribution of this paper is the introduction of an abstract sensor-actuator pair to the subsumption architecture of robots introduced by Brooks (1987). The perceiving side of this pair derives from Gibson's (1979) affordance, which is a form of grasping of situations involving perceived objects. This study is part of a new form of evolutionary robotics called cognitive robotics. It considers a new context for a classical form of learning, namely, habitation. The inspiration for the form of affordances described in this paper comes from Heidegger's (1982) notion of the convergence of the concurrent activities of building, dwelling and thinking. In some sense, building and dwelling are at the threshhold of thinking. A brief description of the form and functioning of abstract S-A pairs is given.

The sample was 111 students who worked in two experimental groups and in a control group. The evaluation of the development of variational thinking was carried out according to covariational reasoning. The results show that the application of the strategy allowed the development of variational thinking because it significantly improved the level of covariational reasoning, allowing students to develop and strengthen skills to coordinate the amount of change in the variables.

The combination of these approaches provides a better understanding of the scenario alternatives available to decision makers. This is, recognizing the context of the focal question with creative scenario plots that show the interaction between its key drivers. Therefore, the hybrid model, should be useful to unify the strategic point of view by recognizing the most plausible scenario, while reducing the uncertainty due to ambiguous value judgments by Key Decision Makers (KDMs).The work presented in this article aims to develop hybrid model by combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to engage a new non-linear form of systems thinking about the future. The article includes a conceptual model and an experimental case that develops a case for rethinking the ideas of a research system for a local organization.The article ends with a reflection on outcomes and suggests ways for future research.

In this review, we started with reviewing theories of parental involvement. Then we investigated and categorized types of parental involvement, parent roles, and parents’ psychological factors in the parenting process. We also supplemented a new involvement form in Level 2 of Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler’s Model of Parental Involvement in CT Education, namely parents’ support with concerns about using technology and CT tools. We proposed the Model of Parental Involvement in Computational Thinking Education. We conducted comprehensive research of related studies on parental involvement in CT education and identified the research gap in involving parents in children’s CT learning.

AB  - To address pattern classification problems without involving complex computations, a Hash-Based Convolutional Deep-Thinking Pattern Classifier (HCDTPC) has been developed. This classifier draws inspiration from the human visual system and human thinking logic. The architecture consists of five layers, each serving a distinct purpose. In the initial convolutional layer, informative and distinct features are extracted, mimicking the functionality of the human visual system. The subsequent clustering layer employs a clustering algorithm to group samples within a class into smaller clusters. This arrangement allows the following layer to compare test samples across different clusters, replicating a human-like classification process where the most similar samples should belong to the same group. The hashing layer of the devised system employs a similarity-preserve hashing technique to transform feature maps into hashed data. This transformation reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining essential similarity information. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is employed to classify testing samples, mirroring human thought processes. The simulation section assesses the performance of the HCDTPC, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in pattern classification.

AB  - In this paper, we combined a visualization tool and Dr. Scratch website service to support instructors evaluating the Scratch projects on an online social networking forum: scratch.mit.edu. Scratch is a visual programming language used by youth to design programs like animation, game, or music. Their computational thinking skills take place around program decompositions, program patterns, and data representation in the shared Scratch programs (called projects). Through the exploratory work, we found that some cues, such as deep nested iteration, may be successfully used as indicators of users computational thinking skills. This suggests future directions for assessing youths computational thinking skills development and educational opportunities emerging from shared Scratch projects.

AB  - This paper offers a short summary and critical review of the forthcoming book "AI-Driven Research Intelligence: Integrating 3C Theory from Foundational Abilities to Advanced Research Thinking". The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has transformed scientific research, prompting the need for theories on human-AI collaboration. This book introduces the 3C Theory, which integrates AI with human cognition, emotion, and research thinking (critical thinking, creative thinking, and computational thinking). Within the 3C theoretical model, AI not only as a research tool but as an enhancer of human cognitive abilities, emotional regulation, and research thinking. By comparing 3C Theory with existing models, the book highlights its potential to transform research processes and support the design of intelligent Human-AI research systems. Additionally, this paper explores the prospects of intelligent research system design, proposing new avenues for research innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration and Human-AI interaction.

AB  - This work aims to explore the application of the physical and digital twin pair as a computational thinking instrument to support learning and exercise proportional reasoning at the ages at which pursuing STEM studies is decided. Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8–9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8–9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.

AB  - With the rapid development of global supply chain, the existing methodology and solution struggle to cope with the operation of complex logistics systems (CLS). Thereupon, the computational logistics is suggested systematically from the perspectives of definition evolution, conceptual architecture, problem-oriented exploration, and practical philosophy. All provide an elementary sketch and synopsis of CLS oriented scheduling and decision methodology. Subsequently, a typical application of computational logistics is discussed on a container terminal handling system (CTHS). After the abstraction and automation of container terminal-oriented logistics generalized computation, the memory access model and computing principles in computer science are transferred and integrated to propose the yard facility-block accessing and switching model (YFB-ASM). The processor affinity, spatial locality and cooperative computing of CTHS are discussed according to the practice data in a large-scale CTHS. The YFB-ASM is supposed to establish a solid foundation for rolling plan, task scheduling, resource allocation and performance analysis of CTHS. It illustrates the feasibility, availability, credibility and practicability of computational logistics preliminarily.
